		<div class="c_text">An Action-Programming based Card Game for 2 or more players. Heavily inspired by the sci-fi action RPG, <a href='https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/' ng-style='{"font-style":"italic"}'>Transistor</a>, by SuperGiant Games. ModuleCG is currently only in a print-and-play format, as it was designed for Paper Jam 4, a tabletop game jam. The project is currently on hiatus, though I am considering a redesign and a conversion to a digital format.</div>

		<div class="c_side">Story</div>
		<div class="c_text">In a world of insanely fast "laser" computing, the only limits a developer faces are their creativity and their Compiler speeds. In this world, where software empires can rise and fall in an instance, you are a rising indie developer, aiming to build your reputation and crush your competition. Now, as your Compiler ramps up, you must out code your competition, or fail and be forever discredited.</div>
