				<li><b>Functions</b> - A type of card. Equipped to units or used individually.</li>
				<li><b>Program</b> - A type of card. A unit used in play.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Process</b> - Action taken by a Program. Usually the resolution of a Function.</li>
				<li><b>Execution</b> - Player called program use. Executions take place after the process they are activated during finishes.</li>
				<li><b>Activated</b> - Program state. Face-up. Programs only start processes while active.</li>
				<li><b>Deactivated</b> - Program state. Face-down. Programs can maintain nulls, but cannot start processes.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Compiler Processing Units(CPU)</b> - These are required to play cards.</li>
				<li><b>Reputation(REP)</b> - The Health of each player.</li>
				<li><b>Integrity(INT)</b> - The Health of each program.</li>
				<li><b>Resistance(RES)</b> - Reduce all incoming damage by this amount.</li>
				<li><b>Charge(CHA)</b> - Increase all outgoing damage by this amount.</li>
				<li><b>Speed(SPD)</b> - Programs with higher speed are called first.</li>
				<li><b>Immune(IMMUNE)</b> - Cannot take damage or be destroyed.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Null</b> - When Function does not fit the requirements of play. Null functions are destroyed when revealed. Having a null  revealed lowers reputation by 1.</li>
				<li><b>Uncalled(Bluff)</b> - When a Function is equipped to a Program without a slot, or without the proper Properties.</li>
				<li><b>Unfinished(Bluff)</b> - When a Function is played face down without spending the required CPU.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Height</b> - The position of a program. New programs are above previous programs. On the board, left is lowest, and right is the highest.</li>
				<li><b>Base Program(Bottom)</b> - A player's lowest program.</li>
				<li><b>Surface Program(Top)</b> - A player's highest program.</li>
